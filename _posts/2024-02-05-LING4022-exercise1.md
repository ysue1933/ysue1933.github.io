The function of the predicate-argument structure is $$ PRED <X, ...> $$. It is great for analyzing Michoacan.

    Practice 1: Consider the following data from the Michoacan dialect of Aztec. Analyze the forms into roots and affixes and propose rules for word structure. How are sentences formed in this language? Is there a distinction between the basic lexical classes of noun and verb in this language, or not?

### Lexicon organization

| Morpheme   | Gloss          | Number of arguments |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------------: |
| **Verb roots** |                 |                   |
| čoka-        |    ‘cry’       | 1                 |
| malti-       |    ‘bath’      | 1                 |
| temu-        |    ‘descend’   | 1                 |
| koči- (?8)   |    ‘sleep’     | 1                 |
| wala-        |    ‘come’      | 1                 |
| molalu-      |    ‘run’       | 1                 |
| **Noun roots** |                 |                |
| šolul        |    ‘child’     |                  |
| siwal        |    ‘woman’     |                |
| lakal        |    ‘man’       |              |
| **Determiners** |              |                |
| se        |    ‘a’     |                      |
| in        |    ‘the’     |                       |
| **Pronouns** |              |                       |
|     ni-      | 1SG          |                        |
| ti-          | 2SG            |                        |
| 0 (zero prefix for third person singular)   |   3SG   |    |
| **Tense marker** |              |                       |
| -a         | PRES                                            |
| -k         | PAST                                           |

**Word (verb) structure**: 

$$ V = pref + Vroot + Nt $$. 

*Note: I need to double check what’s Nt. I do know that the verbs take suffixes to mark tense.*

<hr>

### How are the sentences formed in this language?

The X-bar structure $$ S → V + (NP) $$ may seem reasonable, but it gets redundant when we consider the following.
- Yalwa	 	    temuk		    in	šolul	pin	    kuahlin
- 'Yesterday	he descended	the	child	into	forest'

Then the X-bar structure expands as *S → (TEMP) + V + (NP) + (PP)*. Consider the cases where a word is sufficient for a sentence, such as *tišolul ‘you are a child’*. The X-bar structure doesn't apply to these cases. We need to append one more rule to it.

$$
S → (TEMP)  + V + (NP) + (PP)
$$

$$
S → pref + N
$$

A little redundent, innt? Let's try the predicate-argument structure.

#### An elegant sentence structure

$$
S → PRED  +  ARG
$$

- PRED can be anything but it has to have a prefix. 
- PRED doesn’t have to carry tense.
- ARG can only be N. 
- ARG can be realized in two ways. It can be realized by a prefix if the predicate is a noun. It can also be realized by a prefix and followed by separate words (free morphemes)  if the predicate is a verb.
- example: S → PRED (siwal ~ woman) +  ARG (0 ~ 3SG)

#### Phrasal structure

$$ NP → Determiner + N $$

Note that in English, NP are headed by N, but NP in Michoacan can be headed by V. Essentially, NP is used to specify your description of something that you refer to, or a referral. Hence, the head of NP does not need to be a noun.

<hr>

### N / V distinction
Michoacan has a clear N / V distinction; it is different from Nuu Chah Nulth. 
- Only N follows the determiner ( 8. Koči in siwal	‘the woman sleeps’)
- Only V inflects for tense; N takes no tense if functions as V
- Only N can function as an argument
- Anything can function as a predicate

| Language       | PRED                | ARG               |
| :------------- | :-----------------: | ----------------: |
| English        | V (with tense)      | N                 |
| Michoacan      | N / V (with prefix) | N                 |
| Nuu Chah Nulth |    X (anything)     | X                 |

**Tense marker: difference between English and Michoacan**

In English, tense markers belong to the phrasal category of the sentence. Every sentence needs a tense marker.
In Michoacan, tense markers are word level inflection. Not every sentence needs a tense marker.
