    Practice 2: Do a full grammatical analysis of the following sentences from the Watam language of New Guinea using the Parallel Architectures framework presented in class. This will include a full lexicon with Parallel Architecture information of semantics, morphosyntax and phonology (don’t forget to provide justification for your word class assignments); any needed word formation rules; argument structures for verbs and their grammatical function assignments like subject or object, if relevant; constituent structure rules; and any linking rules between the modules.

**Word (verb) structure**: 

$$ V = pref + Vroot + Nt $$. 

*Note: I need to double check what’s Nt. I do know that the verbs take suffixes to mark tense.*

### How are the sentences formed in this language?

The X-bar structure $$ S → V + (NP) $$ may seem reasonable, but it gets redundant when we consider the following.
- Yalwa	 	    temuk		    in	šolul	pin	    kuahlin
- 'Yesterday	he descended	the	child	into	forest'

Then the X-bar structure expands as *S → (TEMP) + V + (NP) + (PP)*. Consider the cases where a word is sufficient for a sentence, such as *tišolul ‘you are a child’*. The X-bar structure doesn't apply to these cases. We need to append one more rule to it.

$$
S → (TEMP)  + V + (NP) + (PP)
$$

$$
S → pref + N
$$

A little redundent, innt? Let's try the predicate-argument structure.

#### An elegant sentence structure

$$
S → PRED  +  ARG
$$

- PRED can be anything but it has to have a prefix. 
- PRED doesn’t have to carry tense.
- ARG can only be N. 
- ARG can be realized in two ways. It can be realized by a prefix if the predicate is a noun. It can also be realized by a prefix and followed by separate words (free morphemes)  if the predicate is a verb.
- example: S → PRED (siwal ~ woman) +  ARG (0 ~ 3SG)

#### Phrasal structure

$$ NP → Determiner + N $$

Note that in English, NP are headed by N, but NP in Michoacan can be headed by V. Essentially, NP is used to specify your description of something that you refer to, or a referral. Hence, the head of NP does not need to be a noun.
