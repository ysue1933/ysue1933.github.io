In this project, our team from Fudan University and South China Normal University explored the structure of academic writing by analyzing articles from the journal [*Nature Comment*](https://www.nature.com/nature/articles?type=comment). As an undergraduate research assistant, my role involved collecting texts from the journal, cleaning them, and tagging the structure of each article—using a framework known as the stage-move structure—on an online platform with a team of 11 other coders. This initial phase built a comprehensive corpus as the foundation for our research.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/tag_excerpt.jpg" title="tagged text excerpt" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    An excerpt of an annotated text.
</div>


Following the creation of this corpus, our team applied machine learning techniques to develop a model capable of classifying and predicting the stage-move structure in academic writings more broadly. The quest is twofold: to create a system that can automatically recognize different stages of argumentation within academic writing, and to identify the underlying patterns that characterize the organization of scholarly discourse. 

Working on this project has been a valuable learning experience for me, especially in gaining insights into the stage-move framework and the potential of computer-aided analysis in linguistic research.
